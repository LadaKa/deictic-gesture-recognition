\chapter{Design of Robotic System}

\section{Robot Model}

\subsection{Mobile Robot Manipulator}
Overview of main components: mobile base, robotic arm with gripper.\\

\subsection{Sensors}
Depth camera for body tracking and objects detection. \\
LIDAR for navigation and objects detection.\\

\subsection{Separated Vision System}
I decided to use a vision system that is separate from the mobile robotic manipulator due to the limited distance for body tracking and object detection with the ORBBEC Astra camera;\\
otherwise objects would only be detected at a small distance from the robot.
