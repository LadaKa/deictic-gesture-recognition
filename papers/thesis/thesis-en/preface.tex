\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}
I chose the topic of my thesis because of my interest in human-robot interaction. The work focuses on gesture based control, as I believe this approach is the most natural and intuitive method of communicating with robots.\par
A mobile robot manipulator was used to test the control for performing the Pick and Place task in a real environment.\par
The topic is specified in the first chapter, where basic concepts are introduced.\par
The second chapter briefly reviews the history of computer vision, the development of gesture recognition, as well as recent work related to deictic gestures.\par
Gesture control is analyzed in the third chapter, which contains an overview of the types of gestures used and the limitations of gesture recognition with the ORBBEC Astra camera.\par
The control design is described in the next chapter. The structure of the system and its main components, the vision system and the mobile robot manipulator, are described here. Hardware information is also included.\par
The fifth chapter contains a description of the implementation process and installation instructions.
The results of the experiments are presented in the last chapter.\par
