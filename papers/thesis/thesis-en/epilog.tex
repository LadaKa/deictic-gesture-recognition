As expected, the most accurate type of examined pointing gesture was a gesture involving the head and wrist joints. We can achieve sufficient accuracy without the visual feedback.\par
Users prefer different types of gestures and perform pointing gestures with different levels of accuracy. Accuracy can be greatly increased when visual feedback is used for training.\par
I haven't finished the implementation of the Pick And Place task. The mobile robot manipulator does not work autonomously and needs help to manipulate the object. However, the subtasks required for navigation and object manipulation have been completed.\par
I explored and learned several ways to command the robot and will use the knowledge in my future research.\par
