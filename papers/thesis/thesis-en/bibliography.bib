abstract = {The emergence of pointing is a central developmental achievement. Yet, little is known on its ontogenetic roots. Influential developmental theories have proposed that pointing is based on a variety of earlier emerging non-communicative uses of the index finger. To this end, we administered a parent questionnaire and investigated age-related differences in 3- to 24-month-old infants’ (n = 168) use of the index finger for social and non-social functions. Results demonstrate that early in development the index finger is mainly used for non-social purposes – with touching being the most prominent category, and desire for an object and un-intentional movements being further relevant categories. In contrast, imitation was hardly present and became only prominent with the onset of the social function of pointing around 10 months. Overall, the study contributes to a theoretical controversy on the early ontogeny of pointing. It is in line with theoretical views that pointing originates in non-communicative uses of the index finger, most notably touching, and gains its social function in the course of early development.}

@article{TT_2020, title={That and There: Judging the Intent of Pointing Actions with Robotic Arms}, volume={34}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6601}, DOI={10.1609/aaai.v34i06.6601}, abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Collaborative robotics requires effective communication between a robot and a human partner. This work proposes a set of interpretive principles for how a robotic arm can use pointing actions to communicate task information to people by extending existing models from the related literature. These principles are evaluated through studies where English-speaking human subjects view animations of simulated robots instructing pick-and-place tasks. The evaluation distinguishes two classes of pointing actions that arise in pick-and-place tasks: referential pointing (identifying objects) and locating pointing (identifying locations). The study indicates that human subjects show greater flexibility in interpreting the intent of referential pointing compared to locating pointing, which needs to be more deliberate. The results also demonstrate the effects of variation in the environment and task context on the interpretation of pointing. Our corpus, experiments and design principles advance models of context, common sense reasoning and communication in embodied communication.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={06}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Alikhani, Malihe and Khalid, Baber and Shome, Rahul and Mitash, Chaitanya and Bekris, Kostas and Stone, Matthew}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={10343-10351} }
