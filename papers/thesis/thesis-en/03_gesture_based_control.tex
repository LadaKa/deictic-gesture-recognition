Different types: \\
a pointing ray calculated from a pair of skeleton coordinates (head - hand, elbow - wrist, shoulder - wrist, ...)\\

\subsection{Pointing ray}

\section{Confirming gesture}
Some other gesture is required to confirm the pointing gesture. \\
The 'Hand Grip' gesture is not well recognized by the Astra camera, so I choose 'Hand Raise'.\\
