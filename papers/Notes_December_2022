Getting Started with Neobotics MP-500 and the UR5 Robot

	Power on the universal robot arm by pressing the power button on the teach pendant (touch screen)
		- didn't work - because of Neobotix 'emergency stop' state
		
	After the teach pendant is turned on, initialize the robot arm - OK
	
	The arm was manually (freedrive) set into the position to pick a small object from the floor - OK:
		- reach of the arm is sufficient
		- the distance to the object is ok (SICK lidar doesn't raise emergency stop)
		

	VNC View connected to the neobotix server - OK
	
	TODO: connect to ROS master
